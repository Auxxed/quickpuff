"""Is someone sitting at this computer?

Two machines running QuickPuff both want the same Peak, and the Peak only
takes one Bluetooth link at a time. Handoff needs to know which seat is in
use, and there are two ways to ask.

logind knows when a session is switched away, and reports LockedHint when a
lock manager bothers to set it. Omarchy's lock doesn't: it drives the
compositor's own ext-session-lock and never tells logind, so LockedHint stays
"no" through a lock. Hyprland has no lock property either, but an active lock
is one of the reasons a monitor can't go solitary, which is what
omarchy-hyprland-session-locked reads. So the compositor is polled as well,
when that helper is around.

If neither can be reached the seat counts as occupied, so a machine that
can't tell keeps behaving the way it always has.
